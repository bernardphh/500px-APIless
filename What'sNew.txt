Dec 18, 2019:
- used the external files for CSS and Javascripts:
		CSS to  [running folder]/css/styles.css  and 
		JS  to  [running folder]/javascripts/scripts 

- added option to view the result html off-line, by saving the user avatars and photo thumbnails on disk, at these default locations:
		User avatar:  		./avatars
		Photo thumbnails:	./thumbnails
  CON: even the avatar and thumnails images are very small in size, the process will definitely takes longer time to complete
  PRO: when viewing the result html file, for example, an html file with 1000 notification items on it, we would send 2000 images request to
       the server. This wouldn't be so nice, would it? Using local images will bring the server request to zero.  

- provided the easier way to change some settings for the whole script:
		HEADLESS_MODE = True                             
		USE_LOCAL_THUMBNAIL = True                       
		OUTPUT_DIR =  [running folder] / Output
		
- We no longer close the Chrome Driver after finishing an action. We keep it alive so that 
  a logged in session is still in affect.

Aug 3 2019:
- Adapted to 500px structure changes (after the famous "scheduled maintenance"). Affected option: 2. Get photos list

  The photo detail is no longer provided in the convenient format (json). We have to do harder work to get the data.
  We now also added one more info from a photo: the list of galleries, with link, that featured the photo.

Jul 15, 2019:

Changed Output folder location from current (running) directory to %PROGRAMDATA%\500px_APIless\Output (C:\ProgramData\500px_Apiless\Output)
---------------------------
june 4 2019:
- Catched more Selenium exceptions: TimeoutException, NoSuchElementException
- Added new option: check if a user is following you.
- Merge two options 6, 7 into one: When we get the notifications list, we automatically filter the list to make another list
  containing just the unique users, along with its count of appearances.
- Showed process time for each task
- Minimized the usage of time.sleep() to improve performance.
